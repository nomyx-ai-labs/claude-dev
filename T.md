# Project Plan: Incorporating Debugging Tools into Claude Dev

## 1. Overview

This project plan outlines the steps to incorporate VS Code debugging tools into the Claude Dev extension and enable the AI assistant to use these tools effectively. The plan includes updating the extension's architecture, implementing new functionality, and modifying the AI prompt to handle debugging tasks.

## 2. Current Architecture Analysis

The Claude Dev extension is built using the following key components:

- `src/extension.ts`: Main extension file that handles activation, command registration, and provider setup.
- `src/providers/ClaudeDevProvider.ts`: Manages the webview and interaction with the AI assistant.
- `src/api/`: Contains API handlers for different AI providers.
- `src/ClaudeDev/`: Implements various tools and functionalities used by the AI assistant.
- `src/shared/`: Contains shared types and utilities.
- `webview-ui/`: React-based UI for the extension.

## 3. Implementation Plan

### 3.1 Create Debugging Module

1. Create a new file `src/debugger/debuggerController.ts` to implement the debugging tools.
2. Implement the following functions in `debuggerController.ts`:
   - Debugger Control Tools (e.g., `startDebugging`, `stopDebugging`, `pauseDebugging`, etc.)
   - Breakpoint Management (e.g., `addBreakpoint`, `removeBreakpoint`, `getBreakpoints`, etc.)
   - State Inspection (e.g., `getCallStack`, `getVariables`, `evaluateExpression`, etc.)
   - Application Interaction (e.g., `sendInput`, `getOutput`, `setVariable`, etc.)
   - Source Code Navigation (e.g., `openFile`, `getSourceCode`)

3. Use VS Code's Debug API (`vscode.debug`) to implement these functions.

### 3.2 Integrate Debugging Module with Extension

1. Update `src/extension.ts` to initialize the debugging module.
2. Register new commands for debugging actions in `package.json` and `src/extension.ts`.
3. Modify `src/providers/ClaudeDevProvider.ts` to handle debugging-related messages and actions.

### 3.3 Update AI Prompt and Tools

1. Modify `src/ClaudeDev/promptManagement.ts` to include information about debugging capabilities.
2. Update the AI's system prompt to include instructions on how to use the new debugging tools.
3. Implement new tools in the `src/ClaudeDev/` directory for debugging-related tasks:
   - `debugSession.ts`: Manage debug sessions
   - `debugInspection.ts`: Handle state inspection and variable manipulation
   - `debugNavigation.ts`: Handle source code navigation and breakpoint management

### 3.4 Enhance Webview UI

1. Create new React components in `webview-ui/src/components/` for debugging-related UI elements:
   - `DebugControls.tsx`: Buttons for start, stop, pause, continue, step over, step into, step out
   - `BreakpointList.tsx`: Display and manage breakpoints
   - `VariableInspector.tsx`: Show variables and their values
   - `CallStackView.tsx`: Display the call stack

2. Update `webview-ui/src/App.tsx` to incorporate these new components.

### 3.5 Implement Debug Session Management

1. Create a new file `src/debugSession.ts` to manage debug sessions.
2. Implement functions to start, stop, and manage debug configurations.
3. Integrate debug session management with the AI assistant's workflow.

## 4. AI Assistant Enhancements

### 4.1 Update AI Prompt

1. Modify the AI's system prompt in `src/ClaudeDev/promptManagement.ts` to include:
   - Description of new debugging capabilities
   - Instructions on how to use debugging tools
   - Guidelines for when and how to initiate debugging sessions

### 4.2 Extend AI Workflow

1. Update `src/ClaudeDev/recursivelyMakeClaudeRequests.ts` to handle debugging-related tasks:
   - Recognize when debugging is necessary
   - Start and manage debug sessions
   - Use debugging tools to inspect and manipulate application state
   - Provide debugging insights and suggestions to the user

### 4.3 Implement Debugging Scenarios

1. Create example debugging scenarios in `src/ClaudeDev/debuggingScenarios.ts`:
   - Finding and fixing bugs
   - Inspecting application state
   - Stepping through code execution
   - Modifying variables during runtime

2. Train the AI assistant to recognize and handle these scenarios effectively.

## 5. Testing and Validation

1. Update existing tests in `src/test/` to cover new debugging functionality.
2. Create new test cases specifically for debugging scenarios.
3. Implement integration tests to ensure smooth interaction between the AI assistant and debugging tools.

## 6. Documentation and User Guide

1. Update the README.md file with information about the new debugging capabilities.
2. Create a user guide explaining how to use the AI assistant for debugging tasks.
3. Document new commands and features in the extension's documentation.

## 7. Performance Optimization

1. Profile the extension with debugging features enabled to identify any performance bottlenecks.
2. Optimize debug data retrieval and presentation to ensure smooth user experience.

## 8. Security Considerations

1. Implement proper error handling and input validation for all debugging-related functions.
2. Ensure that debugging actions are performed in a sandboxed environment to prevent unintended side effects.

## 9. Deployment and Release

1. Update the extension's version number in `package.json`.
2. Create a changelog documenting the new debugging features.
3. Prepare the extension for publication to the VS Code Marketplace.

By following this project plan, we can successfully incorporate the new debugging tools into the Claude Dev extension and enable the AI assistant to effectively use these tools for debugging tasks.
